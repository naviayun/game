	  <h2>Board Game Exploration</h2>
	  
	  <p>During the board game exploration, we learned that it was hard to keep a player 
		  interested in your game. Since our game was one of the 'first one to get "it"
		  wins!' it could be really hard to keep a player intrigued. We learned that we 
		  needed to think of all the different gamer types to make it more interactive. 
		  However, the ideas behind how a person can play was very interesting as we tried 
		  to figure out what could suit each person's individuality.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Video Game Exploration</h2>
	  
	  <p>The video game exploration applied to our knowledge of the technology. We created an 
		  object that was adaptable to the game, as well as keeping people's interest with t
		  the different coding. Some of the style/mechanical coding for the game goes as 
		  follows:</p>
	  
	  <h2>What is Our Game?</h2>
	  
	  <p>Our game is a game inspired from a mix of Trouble and Monopoly. The main objective is to 'be the first one'. Like in Trouble, you go around in
		  a circle around our game board while having a home base. Your objective is to own your house. You can pass your own property many times, 
		  but that doesn't mean that you get to own your house. Currently you are just renting it from a landowner. There are different spots on the 
		  board that let you do a certain move; such as picking up a card that gives you money or the ability to raise someone else's house profit, 
		  or moving backwards or forwards. Once you get enough money to buy your house, then you can try to get to your original home base. Once you 
		  do, congrats! You've just won the game and now own the house!</p>
