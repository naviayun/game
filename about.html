        <h2>My Personal Favorite Games <3</h2>
        
        <ul> 
             <li>Catan: Every time my siblings and I get together with my dad's side,
                 we play Catan! It can get very competitive and very engaging, which I just
                 love. We've been keeping this a tradition for about 5 years from now, so I 
                 have a lot of memories with the game.
             </li>
             <li>Minecraft: My siblings and I play Bedwars, Minecraft, which is a very fun
                 interactive game. Sometimes we play with our cousins, but it's mostly just
                 us, taking a break from college and school. It can get very hectic but it's mostly
                 just the three of us having a good time.
             </li>
             <li>Capture the Flag: This is a game that can involve a lot of people, from adults to
                 little kids. I have five cousins on both sides and a good amount of uncles and aunts. 
                 When we come together, we have a lot of fun, the adults running (and panting) and the 
                 little kids guarding the jail/flag. It's very engaging and everyone seems to have a good
                 time, including the adults.
            </li>
