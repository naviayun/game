             <li>Capture the Flag: This is a game that can involve a lot of people, from adults to
                 little kids. I have five cousins on both sides and a good amount of uncles and aunts. 
                 When we come together, we have a lot of fun, the adults running (and panting) and the 
                 little kids guarding the jail/flag. It's very engaging and everyone seems to have a good
                 time, including the adults.
