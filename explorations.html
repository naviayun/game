    <h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
    
    <p>During the board game exploration, we learned that it was hard to keep a player interested in the game. Since our game was one of the 'be the last 
      one standing' idea, it could be really hard to keep a player interested. We learned that we needed to think of all the different gamer types to make
      it more intereactive. However, the ideas behind how a person can play was very interesting as we tried to figure out what could suit each person's 
      individuality.</p> 
    
    <h2 id="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
    
    <p>The video game exploration applied to our knowledge of the technology. We created a character that could be adaptable to other people's interests 
      and then created a game with different coding that could be used to entertain. My coding for the game goes as follows:</p>
      
      <pre>
      
def draw():
    screen.fill("light gray")
    screen.draw.filled_rect(main_box, "medium aquamarine")
    screen.draw.filled_rect(timer_box, "medium aquamarine")

    for box in answer_boxes:
        screen.draw.filled_rect(box, "misty rose")

    screen.draw.textbox(str(time_left), timer_box, color = ("black"))
    screen.draw.textbox(question[0], main_box, color=("black"))
    index = 1
    for box in answer_boxes:
        screen.draw.textbox(question[index], box, color=("black"))
        index = index + 1

def game_over():
    global question, time_left
    message = "Game over. You got %s questions correct!" % str(score)
    question = [message, "-", "-", "-", "-", 5]
    time_left = 0

def correct_answer():
    global question, score, time_left

    score = score + 1
    if questions:
        question = questions.pop(0)
        time_left = 10

    else:
        print ("End of questions")
        game_over()

def on_mouse_down(pos):
    index = 1
    for box in answer_boxes:
        if box.collidepoint(pos):
            print("Clicked on answer " + str(index))
            if index == question[5]:
                print("You got it correct")
                correct_answer()
            else:
                game_over()
        index = index + 1

def update_time_left():
    global time_left

    if time_left:
        time_left = time_left - 1
    else:
        game_over()

clock.schedule_interval(update_time_left, 1.0)

def on_key_up(key):
    global score
    if key == keys.H:
        print("The correct answer is box number %s " % question[5])
    if key == keys.SPACE:
        score = score - 1
        correct_answer()
